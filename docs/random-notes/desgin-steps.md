From [my conversation with Claude AI](https://claude.ai/share/de8c826a-4923-4c9d-bcab-62021c88e226)

The design phase typically includes:

Interaction workflows - How users move through the app (user flows, navigation patterns)
Screen layouts - Visual design and UI mockups (wireframes → high-fidelity designs)
Data storage decisions - Database schema, data models, caching strategy

I'd add a few more important design activities:

API integration design - Which weather API to use, how to structure API calls, error handling
Astronomical calculations - Which library/algorithm for moon phases, rise times, azimuth
State management - How the app handles data flow between screens
Component architecture - Breaking down the UI into reusable components

Typical order of these activities:

User flows / interaction workflows (understand the journey)
Wireframes / screen layouts (visualize the interface)
Data model design (what data needs to be stored/managed)
Technical architecture decisions (APIs, libraries, components)
